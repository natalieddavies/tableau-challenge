# My Purpose

Playing the role of a data analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program. I am responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. 

I have combined 8 different datasets from January to September of 2020 and cleaned the data using Python coding in Jupyter Notebook before loading into Tableau public.

I have created interactive dashboards within this story which analyse and provide insights to the CitiBike locations, trips per month in relation to Covid-19 and monthly ride duration categorised by gender.

# About CitiBike

Since 2013, the CitiBike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program and my task is to develop insights to these questions.
